# ClashKudos
ClashKudos is statistic tracking and positive reinforcement tool for Clash of Clans families.

###Details
Unlike many other fantastic tools for Clash of Clans, this project seeks to provide support for clan families. While every other tool I investigated has great features, they were all limited to reporting within a single clan. ClashKudos aims to track statistics for not only a clan, but also its feeders, its sisters, and any other clan that wants to be tracked within the group.

As the name implies, ClashKudos also strives to offer another benefit: **kudos**. Positive reinforcement can provide significant value for a clan; encouraging others to compete in more ways helps also helps showcase the strengths of different players and unify a team under a broader umbrella.

### Installing
